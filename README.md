## Project Description

For this project, I present to you a ‚ú® *fake prescription drug name generator*. ‚ú®
- Do you ever think, 'how did they come up with this truly terrible drug name?' when you're watching commercials in between your favorite episode of The Bachelorette?
- Do you ever ask, 'is this an SNL sketch or is this cable TV?' when you hear promotions for *Tridesivir*, *Hydrofam*, or *Butonial*? 

Well, my site will now take the, albeit very little, thinking out of big pharma's naming processes...

**Enter the *Medpramin*. A website that will randomize a drug name for you based on my own unique data set alongside a medical API with randomized drug facts.** How did I come up with the name *Medpramin*? I generated it from my site! 


## API

I will be using two medical API's: *DailyMed* and *RxNav*. 

### DailyMed

The first API is called [DailyMed](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/app-support-web-services.cfm) and it returns specific drug fact data, for example: "PAROXETINE TABLET, FILM COATED, EXTENDED RELEASE [MODAVAR PHARMACEUTICALS LLC]". I use this data in order to create some real-looking stats for my fake prescription drugs. 

DailyMed offers different details on prescription drugs, but the specific data I want is within this [object](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/services/v2/spls.json), when I make API calls, this is the information I am getting back. I am only using the data within the "title" keys and I have set up a method to randomize which "title" data I get back. 

Below is a small sample of the data, please use the link above to see the full data set. 

```js
{data: {
	{
spl_version: 1,
published_date: "Oct 28, 2021",
title: "ESCITALOPRAM (ESCITSLOPRAM) TABLET [A-S MEDICATION SOLUTIONS]",
setid: "25d450c1-932f-4f5e-b5f7-d3824d3c4efd"
},
{
spl_version: 1,
published_date: "Oct 28, 2021",
title: "RUGBY REGULAR STRENGTH ACETAMINOPHEN (ACETAMINOPHEN) TABLET [REMEDYREPACK INC.]",
setid: "3078e664-4682-41af-bb47-2064f3a8bfc8"
},
{
spl_version: 1,
published_date: "Oct 28, 2021",
title: "DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE INJECTION, SUSPENSION, LIPOSOMAL [PADAGIS US LLC]",
setid: "54e2a32f-7f41-4ed7-926d-f6c9b0b225c6"
},
} }
```


Here is my code demonstrating how I have made the API call to return the data I want to use: 
```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {

  // Random Number Generator
    const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 99) + 1

  // Use State
    const [drugEffects, setDrugEffects] = useState();
  
  // API Call
    const makeAPICall = () => (
      fetch("https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/services/v2/spls.json")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((results) => setDrugEffects(results.data[randomNumber].title)) )

  // Use Effect
    useEffect(() => {
      makeAPICall();
      }, [])

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h3>Here is some random drug info:</h3>
        <p>{drugEffects}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```


### RxNav

My second API returns real, drug brand names. This will be used in my "comparison game," where a user can guess between a randomly-generated *Medpramin* name and a real drug name.

This API comes from the National Library of Medicine at the Lister Hill Center for Biomedical Communications, known as [RxNav](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/). RxNav returns much more data than DailyMed. In fact, I am randomly choosing a drug brand name out of over 5,000 data objects. 

Here is my code demonstrating how I have made the API call to RxNav: 
```js
  // API Call
    const makeAPICall = () => (
      fetch("https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/REST/allconcepts.json?tty=BN")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((results) => setRealName(results.minConceptGroup.minConcept[aBigRandomNumber].name)) )
```

This API Call returns alphabetically-organized data that looks like: 
```js
{
rxcui: "895761",
name: "Actemra",
tty: "BN"
},
{
rxcui: "1040019",
name: "Acthar",
tty: "BN"
},
{
rxcui: "637866",
name: "ActHIB",
tty: "BN"
},
```
Again, I am only using the "name" key to access the brand names randomly.

## Code Snippet 

I am proud of the way I created my own randomized drug names because... they sound real! Sometimes even I am tricked by them. My vision with the prefix, middle, and suffix data worked out exactly as I intended. The random number generators max number refers to how many options I have for each, and the word is put together by simple concatenation! 

```js

const randomNumberPrefix = Math.floor(Math.random() * 33) + 1
const randomNumberMiddle = Math.floor(Math.random() * 32) + 1
const randomNumberSuffix = Math.floor(Math.random() * 35) + 1

const [drugName, setDrugName] = useState();

setDrugName(prefixdata[randomNumberPrefix] + middledata[randomNumberMiddle] + suffixdata[randomNumberSuffix]);

```


## Citations

Here is an online resources that helped me be successful in my project. For my homepage, I wanted the font styling of my "medpramin" title to be very specific. I researched online as to how to stretch the text a little more than the original Google Font, known as MuseoModerno. This [StackOverflow Article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6351013/can-i-stretch-text-using-css) was helpful and I was able to edit it for my own text. I also did a small border line (`text-stroke`) around the letters.

```css

/* Title: "Medpramin" */
      #title {
        text-align: center;
        font-size: 4.15em;
        margin-top: 0;
        padding-top: 10px;
        color: #388A80;
        font-family: 'MuseoModerno', cursive;
        padding-bottom: 0px;
        margin-bottom: 0px; 
        -webkit-transform:scale(1,1.35); /* Safari and Chrome */
          -moz-transform:scale(1,1.35); /* Firefox */
          -ms-transform:scale(1,1.35); /* IE 9 */
          -o-transform:scale(1,1.35); /* Opera */
          transform:scale(1,1.35); /* W3C */
        -webkit-text-stroke: 0.3px #165141;
        -webkit-text-fill-color: #388A80;
      }

```
